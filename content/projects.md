## **Restaurant finder**

A restaurant finder to help you find restaurants based on cuisine and location in realtime. Built using NextJS with code written in React. I used Zomato API to source restaurant data and Google Maps API to show the restaurants on the map. Deployed to Vercel using Continuous Deployment.

[Deployment](https://stit-frontend-challenge.aravindvaddi.vercel.app/) **Note:** Requires location to show restaurants. Location data isn't stored. Defaults to New York City when location isn't accessible.

Exploring web security through XSS, CSRF, SQL injection, password breaking and database encryption using API method.

* [Systems Vulnerabilities](https://github.com/aravindvaddi/systems-attacks-and-defences)
Systems exploitation and fixes, along with AFL for fuzzing, lcov to measure coverage and Travis CI for regression testing.

* [Android Security](https://github.com/aravindvaddi/android-security)
Exploring android security by delving into Intents, using secure API calls, finding vulnerabilities in design and making application lighter and safer by removing unnecessary data collecting code.

* [Password Cracking](https://github.com/aravindvaddi/password-cracking)
